Implement the into SSA and out of SSA transformations on Bril functions. Watch
out for variables that are undefined on some paths. The script â€œis_ssa.py can check if a
program is really in SSA and the Bril interpreter bili supports phi functions so you can
execute code in the midpoint of your round trip. Measure the overhead (does the final
program have more instructions (static or dynamic) the original, be sure to report the
overhead in your writeup.
