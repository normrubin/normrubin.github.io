Follow the LLVM tutorial blog post far enough to implement a pass that changes program execution.

This is intentionally open-ended. You can be as ambitious or as unambitious as you want.
An example of an unambitious but acceptable task would be to print out a message every time the program uses floating-point division.

An example of an ambitious task would be to implement an optimization on LLVM IR and make sure it speeds things up in actual wall-clock time execution.

Find a real-ish C/C++ program somewhere and run your pass on it to observe the results.
