title: homework -  dominance

---

Implement the dominance utilities- 

1) Find dominators for a function, 
2) construct the dominance tree, 
3) compute the dominance frontier. 

Devise a way to test
your implementations. Can you find a way to confirm that block A dominates blockB.
When you code this, 

remember that
checking their output could use slow naive algorithms.
