## jit (just in time) compilers vs aot(ahead of time)  compilers 

a jit compiler translates code into isa while the program executes

pro:
 
 more information

 con:

 compile time slows down execution 

 

## some options

- compile a function the first time it is called
- compile a function after it has been called a lot (needs an interpreter) We call these hot functions 
- build a trace of instructions executed and compile the hot traces (a trace has no branches)
- A variation I used: ran the program to completion using a tracing interpreter, recompile off line, future execution is  a mix of interpreter and compiled code  

## Can jit compiled code run faster then aot code?


## Comparison  


aot | jit
----| ----
cannot inline libraries | can inline (even class methods)
no runtime code gen | can use run time code gen
no speculative opts |  can use spec opts 
less information    | more information 
overall performance lower | overall performance often higher 
full speed from the start | requires warmup
no compile cost at run time | overhead to run compiler 


## Tradeoffs 

1. The time to compile is part of the total execution time 
1. might run less optimizations to speed up execution time 
1. might look at run time info
1. same code might be compiled many times 

Why would the same code be compiled more than once?


## tiered compilers 

Since compilation is costly, do not compile functions 
that are only called once and do not contain a long running loop

we have a series of compilers, each with more aggressive optimization and each allowed to take longer

- the lowest tier is the interpreter 
- the next is the base line compiler 

---

1. start interpreting the code 
1. if some part of the code takes a long time, compile it with the next higher tier 
1. is some runtime info changes, compile it again

## magic numbers 

associate a counter with branches and functions 
if the counter reaches some magic number use one of the compilers

if the counter for a backward branch, you  recompile, but the code is executing in  the middle of a loop,  how do you insert the newly compiled code?



## questions when building a  JIT

- what strategy do you use to invoke the jit
- do you have to execute for a while before calling the jit
-  how much info do you need
-  what is the price of wrong info
-  are there easy and hard programs 
-  do the easy programs match up with users common programs

## Speculation 

- assume some property is true, compile using that info
this is always a gamble, so you need to recover if the assumption was wrong 
- assume a variable is an int, and does not overflow 
- assume properties of an object is fixed 
- assume the target of call is always the same 
- assume past behavior predicts future behavior 

## flow

```


## boxed values 

Many languages do not use strong static typing 

for example in python

x = x + 1 

x could be an int/float/object/string etc 

the value of x needs to carry a type. Represent x as a pair (type, pointer or bits)
The pair is called a boxed value 

then to generate code for the plus we have to figure out what kind of add, based on the type


## inline caches 

in languages like python, calls to a method are more expensive then calls to a 
method in c++ why?

. . . 

Python objects are  implemented as  hash tables. While C++ uses virtual tables

how does that effect the cost?


## first C++ virtual tables 

in C++ a method call takes two dereferences 

1. first find the v-table
1. second used a ***fixed offset*** from the table start to find the address

## What do we need to keep the offset fixed?
 

if derived inherits from base, and both have a function f.
the offset to f has to be the same.

in languages where objects are hash tables, the c++ dereference becomes a hash table lookup, which is slower 

## tradeoffs 

In a dynamically typed language like python we can add or remove methods easily

but method calls are expensive 

we want to make these calls cheaper 

## inline caches at each call site 

the first time we call a method, we know the type (because we are generating code at runtime)


::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

```
def func(a,b,c):
  for i in range(10):
     foo(a,b,c)
```

:::

::: {.column}

```
def func(a,b,c):
  for i in range(10):
    if isinstance(a, type1)
      body of foo  
    else:
      other = lookup 'foo' in the hash
      call other(a,b,c
      )
```

:::

:::



## inline caches at the function site 

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

```
def func(a,b,c):
  for i in range(10):
     _foo(a,b,c
```

:::

::: {.column}

```
def _foo(a,b,c)
  if isinstance(a, type1)
      body of foo  
    else:
      other = lookup 'foo' in a
      call other(a,b,c)
```
:::

::: 


is it better to do this at the call site or at the function site?


## polymorphic calls 

if the type changes at runtime (the call to other
is taken)  does the optimization help?

could invalidate the table and rebuild it with another case 

## what are the costs 

for example v8 compiler

monomorphic inline hit - 10 instructions 

polymorphic hit - 35 instructions for 10 types, 60 instructions for 20 types 

cache miss 1000-4000 instructions 

## value specialization 

Oddly many functions are called with the same arguments 
 

## an example 

 given a vector v of size n, and a parameter q
 find the element of v that is closest to q

```
 function closest(v, q, n) {
    if (n == 0) {
          throw "Error";
    } else {
        var i = 0;
        var d = 0ffffffff;
        while (i < n) {
           var nd = abs(v[i] - q);
           if (nd <= d) d = nd; 
           i++;
        }    
        return d;  
      } 
}
```

## the cfg 

we want to recompile this for specific v,q, and n, where we restart at the while test

## results 

specialized code is shorter and compiles faster 

since we know that the loop goes from 42 to 100, we could unroll the loop  

## dynamic compilation and pgo (profile guided optimization)

workload dependent -- dynamically you only measure what you actually see -- that can lead to sub-optimal choices if you make them "forever"


If your program has phases, where it does some kind of behavior for a while, and then shifts to another behavior afterwards, then that workload that you originally measured isn't representative anymore!

When you do PGO you're supposed to do it on the entire program and it's supposed to be representative, whereas when you're tracing you're doing that live! 


## confidence vs time 

set the magic numbers high- run a long time slowly, but gather more info

set the magic number low,  quickly recompile based on less info 

# Dynamic Compilers part 2


## C++ method call  

each object has a pointer to a vtable, which is a table of function pointers to all the virtual functions 

each derived object has its own vtable, which has the same offsets for all the common virtual functions 

to find the code takes two dereferences

1. find the vtable (one per class) (one load)
1. at a fixed offset (determined by the virtual function name) find the code (second load)


## a python example 

more flexible 

1. find the hash table (one per instance)
1. lookup the virtual function in the hash table 

```

class Thing:
    def __init__(self, kind):
        self.kind = kind 

thing = Thing('car')

def honk(self):
    print(f"{self.kind} says Honk")

thing.honk = honk.__get__(thing)  ## add a method dynamically to one instance 

thing.honk()  ## call it 

```

honk.__get__(thing) returns a bound method, when this method is called thing is passed as first argument 


## dynamic chunks

So far:

1. run interpreter or tier 0 compiler 
1. collect statistics on call counts or branch counts 
1. when count is high enough recompile the hot functions 
1. specialize the hot functions based on common values 

## The unit of compilation is the static function  

an alterative is called ***trace compilation***  

1. run interpreter or tier 0 compiler 
1. collect the statements executed (no not collect control flow)
1. this produces a linear trace of instructions 
1. recompile the trace using optimizations like value numbering 
1. if the next time the code executes, it takes a different path, fix things up




## trace compilation 0

In a linear trace the number of assumptions you're making accumulates as you execute [towards the end of the trace you have the most assumptions built up]

If you have an always-taken control flow, e.g. some virtual function call that's always calling the same actual function, a tracing compiler will treat all back-to-back branches as one set of straight line code

execute this all back to back, and, whenever convenient, check whether any of those assumptions were wrong"

## cold path

On the "cold path" -- again, when it's convenient undo all the inapplicable things if it turns out the branches weren't true

Called a "bailout" ["bailing out" of the trace]

At a bailout there is new information. something you didn't observe when you were tracing

You trust that everything you've trace is going to happen, it's all going to well, and you're going to be able to optimize for it

But then at runtime, when convenient, you're going to check, and then bail if you were wrong, and have the rollback on the cold path

So the hot path, the one you're pretty sure is going to execute, is quite optimal


## trace compilation 2

tracing jit: extract a hot path (not a function)


Hot paths are compiled as a single basic block, but the path might go through a call 

gamble: next execution starting at this point,  go the same way, no branches leave the path

generate machine code for hot paths interpret the rest of the program 


unlike specialization, tracing assumes the same path but not the same values

## how do this in Bril?

3 new operations (sort of like out-of-order instructions)

1. speculate - Enter a speculative execution context. No arguments.
1. commit -  End the current speculative context, committing the current speculative state as the "real" state. No arguments.
1. guard  - Check a condition and possibly abort the current speculative context. One argument, the Boolean condition, and one label, to which control is transferred on abort.

## speculate extension

[speculative execution extension](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril/blob/main/docs/lang/spec.md)


## example 

  b: bool = const false;      

  v: int = const 4;            v == 4  
  speculate;
  v: int = const 2;            v == 2 (speculate state)
  guard b .failed;             v == 2 (speculate state)
  commit;                      

.failed:
  print v;                     v == 4



## implementation 

you can add a tracer to an interpreter 

In a lot of language environments you'll have an interpreter that's executing "op at a time"

hook in a tracer which observes what the interpreter is doing and "make some machine code on the side" based on how the interpreter ran

you can implement just a subset of the operations [ed: you might call this property "compiler completeness" for your op set


## common bytecode operations 

implement only the common ones and simply end the trace when you hit one that was not implemented, because it was uncommon


You can build up this trace JIT-ing capability over time, because the system is built with this assumption you can bail out of the trace for whatever reason and go back to thr interpreter

## an example 

Could imagine making a JIT that just:
Covered MULs and ADDs and could make fused/composite MUL/ADD bytecode combinations 

Specialize that for one common type; e.g. if you have many types in your language, could support that just for integer types, or just for FP ops e.g. if it were numerical code, and then just bail if any other types showed up at runtime;

trace invariants:  suppose  traces call to other traces; 

trace1 set of ops A, trace2 with set of ops B
and we see a transfer from A to B 

make sure that the assumptions between those two things are lining up -- called ***trace fusion*** 

know the invariants (i.e. "what must be true") on the exit from A and the entry to B are lining up / compatible with each other


## method inlining 

In trace compiler you just execute through methods

Inlining kind of the natural path of compilation when doing trace compilation -- just linear execution where the jumps/calls/returns simply disappear


## tail duplication 

it is common that multiple traces have a common tail

```
for() {
  if op_Eq{
     op1 
   } else {
      op2
   }
}
op_t
op_a
op_i
op_l
```

```
trace0:  op_eq quard\true  op1 op_t op_a op_i op_l 

trace1:              \false op2 op_t op_a op_i op_l 
```

two traces with the same ending, could generate

one copy of the tail- with arguments showing the header

two copies of the tail- frozen header 



## adding traces to bril

How to modify the reference interpreter  (warning typescript!)

[brili](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril/blob/main/brili.ts)


there are two functions to consider 

1. evalFunc interprets a function by calling evalInstr on each instruction 
1. evalInstr interprets one instruction, large case statement 
for each instruction 


## print instructions as they execute

1. figure out when to start and when to stop 
1. how to print instructions (modify evalInstr by printing instructions)
console.log(instr)

you have to optimize the trace and put it back 


## traces and users 

when a trace works well- it looks amazing - it finds the inner loop and optimizes even through libraries 

but users find in hard to understand what the compiler did,

a tiny source change can make a big trace change 

hard to fit in a debugger 

security is a problem 

## pytorch 2.0

ml frameworks have two modes 

## Eager Mode

- Preferred by users
- Easier to use programming model
- Easy to debug

a + b + c executes two calls to torch.add (if they are tensors)

no place to optimize, allows any kind of python, and any control flow 

- PyTorch is a primarily an eager mode framework

## Graph Mode

- Preferred by backends and framework builders
- Easier to optimize with a compiler
- Easier to do automated transformations

construct a graph with two add nodes and 3 input nodes, then execute the graph 

easy to optimize, only graph nodes allowed, no control flow

Main optimization is fusing operations to avoid memory copies 



## how does the compiler fit

in Eager mode there is only a library - no compiler

if you have a matmul followed by an activation function, it is up to the developer to notice that the memory traffic is more expensive then the activation and its up to the developer to know there is another pytorch call (2000 different calls) which does the combined operation and it is up to the developer to change the code 

if graph mode (compiler writers call this defered or late) the operations get recorded (not executed) and only get executed when we need the result 


## PyTorch’s Many Attempts at Graph Modes

torch.jit.trace

1. Record + replay
1.  Unsound
1.  Can give incorrect results because it ignores Python part of program

torch. jit.script

1. AOT parses Python into graph format
1.  Only works on ~45% of real world models
1.  High effort to “TorchScript” models
1. PyTorch Models Are Not Static Graphs

PyTorch users write models where program graphs are impossible

Convert tensors to native Python types (x.item(), x.tolist(), int(x), etc)

Use other frameworks (numpy/xarray/etc) for part of their model

Data dependent Python control flow or other dynamism
Exceptions, closures, generators, classes, etc

torch xla

defered execution. rather then do the graph operation, just save it and execute as late as possible

very slow, big performance cliffs 


## torch.compile(model) -  converts a pytorch eager program to a graph 

torch.dynamo - which dynamically captures Python code execution and creates a static computational graph.

torch.Inductor- compiler that optimimzes static computation graphs


## dynamo 

```
import torch
from typing import List

import torch._dynamo
torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True

def my_compiler(gm: torch.fx.GraphModule, example_inputs: List[torch.Tensor]):

## implementation  


python builds a frameObject (pointer to codeObject + arguments)

passes this to eval 

codeObject allows for extra user data and for a user function to be called between the frameObject and eval 

This makes it easy to add a custom JIT

split the function into two parts -  the python part and the torch part

This is reused if the guards pass 


## pytorch example 1

```
def toy_example(a,b):
    x = a / (torch.abs(a)+1)
    if b.sum() < 0:
        b  = b * -1
    return x *b

for _ in range(100):
    toy_example(torch.randn(10), torch.randn(10))
```

sometimes the sum is negative but not always

## special cases

Trace integers symbolically 

by default it specilizes on every integer in the graph but if a subsequent vall the value changes it traces symbolically 
but 0 or 1 are always speciaized

## implementation  

pep 523,  allows python function to see unevaluated frames, function + arguments 

normally just calls the function
