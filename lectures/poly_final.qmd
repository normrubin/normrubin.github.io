## What Are Polyhedral Methods 

- Many modern programs in fields like High-Performance Computing (HPC), GPU programming, scientific applications and machine learning are loop-intensive.

- Traditional compiler techniques encounter several challenges in these contexts:

## challenges

  1. **Complex Loop Dependencies**: 
     - Dependencies can exist both within a loop and across multiple loops, limiting optimization potential.

  2. **Missed Parallelism**: 
     - Insufficient analysis may prevent identification of potential parallel execution paths, underutilizing hardware capabilities.

  3. **Poor Data Locality**:
     - Inefficient usage of cache memory leads to performance bottlenecks.

Polyhedral methods address these challenges by providing a precise mathematical framework for analyzing and optimizing loop nests.


## Challenges in Traditional Loop Optimization

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < N; i++)  
  for (j = 0; j < N; j++)  
    A[i][j] = A[i-1][j] + A[i][j-1];
```


1. **Iteration Dependencies**
   - $A[i][j]$ depends on $A[i-1][j]$ and $A[i][j-1]$
   - Limits parallel execution due to data dependencies.

2. **Performance Bottleneck**
    - Without optimization such as tiling, loop execution suffers from cache misses.

## Improving Loop Performance by tiling 

### Benefits of Tiling

- **Improved Cache Access Patterns**
  - Reduces cache misses by increasing data locality.
  
- **Enhanced Parallelism**
  - Breaking dependencies across tiles can allow independent execution of tiles on different processors.

## Example Tiling Transformation

Transform the inner loops by introducing tile sizes $T_i$ and $T_j$:

```cpp
for (ii = 0; ii < N; ii += T_i)
  for (jj = 0; jj < N; jj += T_j)
    for (i = ii; i < min(ii + T_i, N); i++)
      for (j = jj; j < min(jj + T_j, N); j++)
        A[i][j] = A[i-1][j] + A[i][j-1];
```

## Limitations of Polyhedral Methods

- **Affine Loops**: 
  - Only applicable to loops with linear bounds and affine array accesses.
  - Example: Bounds and accesses must be simple linear expressions of loop indices.

  - **Static Control Flow**:
  - Methods require loops without complex control flow such as recursion or unpredictable branches (virtual functions).


## scops

  Regions of code that can be handled in the polyhedral model are usually called Static Control Parts, abbreviated as SCoPs. 
  
  Usually, SCoPs may only contain regular control flow free of exceptions and other constructs that may provoke changes in control flow such as conditional expressions dependent on data (read from memory) or side effects of function calls. 
  
  loop free code can be a wrapped in  for(i = 0; i < 1; i++){}

## two kinds of problems 

### Polyhedral Analysis
  Given a transformation. 
    - Does a transformation preserve the loop's semantics?
    - What is the resulting loop structure after transformation?

### Polyhedral Scheduling

  Find the "best" transformation that optimizes a property such as parallelism or data locality.

  



## Advantages of Polyhedral Methods

### Mathematical Rigor

- **Affine Constraints**: 
  - Precisely model and manipulate loops, ensuring correctness.

### Advanced Optimizations Enabled

- **Loop Tiling**: 
  - Boosts data locality by breaking loops into smaller blocks.
- **Loop Fusion**: 
  - Minimizes overhead and improves cache performance by combining adjacent loops.
- **Skewing and Parallelization**: 
  - Addresses complex dependencies, allowing effective parallel execution.

##  Loop Execution

### Statements and Instances

- In loops, statements can execute multiple times.
- Each execution of a statement is called  an **instance**.
- Polyhedral methods  track these instances explicitly.

```cpp
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
  s: a[i] = 3  // Statement `s` executes four times (4 instances)
```

## Program Representation

1. **Statements and Index Sets**
   - Define what computations to perform.
   - Specify the indices for which these computations are valid.

2. **Schedule**
   - specifies  the order in which the indices are executed.



## Toy Example: Changing the Order of Iterations

Problem: Can we reverse this loop's execution order?


```
for i = [1,2,3,4]
s:   a[i] = a[i-1]
```
Original schedule: i = 1, 2, 3, 4

Reversed schedule: i = 4, 3, 2, 1

Do these loops produce the same result? 

```
for i = [1,2,3,4]      			for i = [4,3,2,1]
s:   a[i] = a[i-1]      		 s:   a[i] = a[i-1] 
```

## Execution Trace and Data Access

|Original Order |	Reversed Order|
|---------------| -----------------|
| Instance s(1): Reads a[0], Writes a[1]	|Instance s(4): Reads a[3], Writes a[4]|
| Instance s(2): Reads a[1], Writes a[2]	|Instance s(3): Reads a[2], Writes a[3]|
| Instance s(3): Reads a[2], Writes a[3]	|Instance s(2): Reads a[1], Writes a[2]|
| Instance s(4): Reads a[3], Writes a[4]	|Instance s(1): Reads a[0], Writes a[1]|

## data dependency 

The data dependency arises from the use of $𝑎[𝑖−1]$ which has to be computed before $a[i]$

This kind of data dependency is called read after write or raw dependency

### transformation

we propose a transformation $i \rightarrow 5 -i$ Does this transformation preserve all the dependencies? 

a transformation is a change to the schedule 

## Schedules:

A schedule is a function:

$$s(\text{iteration}) = \text{execution order}(\text{time})$$

Example:

Original order: s(i) = i

Reversed order: s(i) = 5 - i

Producers must execute before consumers for the transformation to be valid.


## schedule validity 

not valid:  if there is a pair $i$,$j$, $s[i]$ produces a value, $s[j]$ reads that value, and $s[j]$ is first in the new schedule

How do we find such a pair?

## Visualization

- **Graphical Representation**:
  - Nodes represent statements with iteration index.
  - Directed edges indicate data dependencies.
  - Valid schedules respect edge directions.

## forward order 

```{python}
iteration_space = [1,2,3,4]
dependences = [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)]
schedule = [1,2,3,4]
draw_1d_iteration_space_with_dependence_graph(iteration_space, dependences, schedule)
```


## backward order


```{python}
iteration_space = [1,2,3,4]
dependences = [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)]
schedule= [4,3,2,1]
draw_1d_iteration_space_with_dependence_graph(iteration_space, dependences, schedule)
```

a schedule is not valid if the arrows go in different directions 

## more analytical check for valid 


There are a number of tests for validity.

Mathematical Condition

- Find $i, j$ where:
$$\text{s}(i) < \text{s}(j) : i \text{ executes first}$$

  - $i$ reads a value.
  - $j$ writes that value.

One: an integer linear programming solver (ILP) to find an integer solution to the equations.

NP-hard but efficient solvers exist for many of the  small cases found in programs

Two: check for a cycle in the graph 

## Analyzing Parallelism in Nested Loops

### Code Example

```
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    for j in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
        a[i, j] = a[i, j-1] + a[i-1, j]
```

Can this Loop Nest be Executed in Parallel?

***data  dependence*** is a mapping: 

 $s(i) => s(i+1)$ from instance to instance  


## Horizontal Dependency:

Each iteration (i, j) depends on (i, j-1) (the value to the left in the same row).

    1. For example, a[1, 2] = a[1, 1] + a[0, 2], which means a[1, 2] depends on the value of a[1, 1] from the same row. 
    1. (1,1) -> (1,2)

## Vertical Dependency:

Each iteration (i, j) depends on (i-1, j) (the value from the previous row in the same column).

    1. For example, a[2, 1] = a[1, 1] + a[2, 0], meaning a[2, 1] depends on a[1, 1] from the row above
    1. (1,1) -> (2,1)

## Data Dependencies


   - **True Dependency (Flow Dependency)**: When an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction.
     - Example: `A = B + C` followed by `D = A + E`
   - **Anti Dependency**: Occurs when an instruction requires a variable that will be overwritten by a subsequent instruction.
   - **Output Dependency**: When two instructions write to the same location, creating a dependency on the order of execution.

## serial schedule

In a serial execution, iterations proceed row by row, strictly respecting both horizontal and vertical dependencies. This schedule respects all dependencies but executes sequentially, limiting parallelism.


## visualization 

```{python}

iteration_space = [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),
                    (2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),
                    (3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),
                    (4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4)]
dependences = []
for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 5):
        if j > 1:  # Horizontal dependency
            dependences.append(( (i, j-1),(i, j)))
        if i > 1:  # Vertical dependency
            dependences.append(((i-1, j),(i, j) ))

schedule = [(i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(1, 5)]
draw_2d_iteration_space_with_dependence_graph(iteration_space, dependences, schedule)
```


## skewing the loops Parallel Schedule: Diagonal Parallelism

To maximize parallel execution in matrix computations, it’s crucial to identify and execute independent iterations simultaneously. One efficient strategy is **Diagonal Parallelism**:

- **Diagonal Organization**: Process iterations by diagonals in the iteration space.
- **Diagonal Key**: Defined as `i + j` (sum of indices).
- **Parallel Execution**: Iterations with the same diagonal key (`i + j` constant) can be executed in parallel since they are independent.

## Example: Diagonal Scheduling Code

```{python}
# Organize the iteration space by diagonals
diagonals = {}
for (i, j) in iteration_space:
    diag_key = i + j  # Diagonal key: sum of indices
    if diag_key not in diagonals:
        diagonals[diag_key] = []
    diagonals[diag_key].append((i, j))

# Sort the diagonals by diagonal key
sorted_diagonals = sorted(diagonals.keys())

# Print the diagonal schedule
print("Diagonal Schedule:")
print(diagonals)

```


## Visualizing the parallel schedule:

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Define iteration space (e.g., for a 3x3 loop nest)
iteration_space = [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4)]

# Define dependences (e.g., data dependences)
dependences = []
for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 5):
        if j > 1:  # Horizontal dependency
            dependences.append(( (i, j-1),(i, j)))
        if i > 1:  # Vertical dependency
            dependences.append(((i-1, j),(i, j) ))


schedule = [(1, 1),(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1),(2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)]
       


draw_2d_iteration_space_with_dependence_graph(iteration_space, dependences, schedule)
```

each diagonal line can run in parallel 

## Benefits of Diagonal Scheduling

1. **Maximized Parallelism**: All iterations of a diagonal can run concurrently.
2. **Improved Cache Locality**: Access patterns aligned to diagonals enhance data locality.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scalable on systems with symmetric multi-processing capabilities.

## Definitions 

## Affine Functions of Loop Indexes

An **affine function** $f(\vec{v})$ is defined as:

$$f(\vec{v}) = M_f \vec{v} + \vec{f}_0$$

where:

- **$\vec{v}$** is a $d$-dimensional vector of loop indices:

  $$\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_d \end{pmatrix}$$

- **$M_f$** is an integer matrix with $k$ rows and $d$ columns:

  $$M_f \in \mathbb{Z}^{k \times d}$$

- **$\vec{f}_0$** is a $k$-dimensional integer translation vector:

  $$\vec{f}_0 \in \mathbb{Z}^k$$

Note: All components are integers $\mathbb{Z}$.


## affine functions

An affine function is a linear transformation followed by a translation. For example, each loop iteration $\vec{v}$ (e.g., $(i, j)$ in a 2D nested loop) can map iteration indices to dependence locations.

##  Loop Nest Types:

**Perfect Loop Nest:**

  - Definition: All statements are contained within the body of the innermost loop.
  - Example: 

  ```
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            a[i][j] = i + j;
        }
    }
  ```
  
## Imperfect Loop Nest

  - Definition: There are statements located outside the innermost loop.
  - Example: 

```
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        b[i] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            a[i][j] += i * j;
        }
    }
```

## Affine Loop Nest:

- **Characteristics:**
  - Loop bounds and array accesses are affine functions of outer loop variables and program parameters.
  - Program parameters (e.g., $N$, $\beta$) are symbolic constants representing problem size.
  

## domains in affine loops 

if we look at the domain or index set  of an affine loop nest we have a convex polyhedron


## Understanding Polyhedrons and Polytopes

- **Polyhedron**: Intersection of a finite number of planes.
- **Polytope**: A bounded polyhedron.



## Polyhedron Representation

- Compact representation of a polyhedron:
  $$
  \{\vec{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n \mid A \vec{x} + \vec{b} \geq \vec{0}\}
  $$
  - $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$
  - $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$

  
## Iteration Vector

The  iteration vector $\vec{i}_S$ for a statement $S$ is a vector of loop indices from outermost to innermost. It represents a dynamic instance of $S$ in a loop nest.

## Domain or Index Set

The domain (or index set) of a statement $S$ is the set of all its iteration vectors.

## compiler  notation

```
for (i=0 ; i<N ; i++)
    for (j=0 ; j<N ; j++) 
          s1: a(i, j) = a(i - 1, j) + 1; 

```

just the domain 

$$
\begin{aligned}
i & \geq 0 \\
j & \geq 0 \\
-i+N-1 & \geq 0 \\
-j+N-1 & \geq 0
\end{aligned} \quad \quad \mathcal{D}^{S_{1}}:\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & 1 & -1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
i \\
j \\
N \\
1
\end{array}\right) \geq 0
$$

We use a matrix and a vector to store a domain

## adding in the dependence 

we have ($i_\text{src}$,  $j_\text{src}$),  ($i_\text{dest}$,  $j_\text{dest})$

both pairs are in the iteration space and   $i_{\text{dest}} = i_{\text{src}} + 1, \quad j_{\text{dest}} = j_{\text{src}}$.




$$
\quad \quad \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 &0&0&  1 & -1 \\
0 & -1 &0& 0& 1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
-0 & 0 &-1&0&  1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 &0& -1 & 1 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 1 &0 &0 &0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 1 &0 &1 
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
i_\text{src} \\
j_\text{src} \\
i_\text{dest}\\
j_\text{dest}\\
1\\
N
\end{array}\right) \geq 0
$$




## Understanding Dependence in Matrix Computation

### Original Code

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
  for (j = 0; j < N; j++) 
     S1: A[i, j] = A[i, j] + u1[i] * v1[j] + u2[i] * v2[j];

for (k = 0; k < N; k++)
  for (l = 0; l < N; l++)
     S2: x[k] = x[k] + beta * A[l, k] * y[l];
```



- **Data Dependence**: Occurs when multiple operations require reading from or writing to the same memory location.


## matrix locations

- **Matrix Location Relation**: `A[i, j]` potentially overlaps with `A[l, k]`.

when 

  - \(0 \le i < N\)
  - \(0 \le j < N\)
  - \(0 \le k < N\)
  - \(0 \le l < N\)

- **Dependence Conditions**:
  - If \(i - l = 0\), then the loop in `S1` depends on the loop in `S2`.
  - If \(j - k = 0\), there is potential write-after-read or read-after-write dependencies.



## Loop Interchange Example

### Original Loop Structure
```c
for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)
  for (j = i; j < 7 && j < i + 4; j++)
     a[i,j] = 3;
```

### Question
- Can we reorder these loops?
- Yes, we can reorder because there is **no dependence**.

**Challenge**: Determine the new loop bounds after interchange.

## domain 

```{python}
#| echo: false
domain = []

# Populate the domain based on original loop constraints
for i in range(9):  # i = 0 to 8
    for j in range(i, min(7, i + 4)):  # j starts from i, and is less than both 7 and i+4
        domain.append((i,j))

dependences = []

draw_2d_iteration_space_with_dependence_graph(domain, dependences)
```

## loop bounds 

```
original 

for (i = 0, i < 9; i++)
  for (j = i; j < 7 && j < i+4; j++)
     a[i,j] =  3

```

```
reordered 

for (j = 0; j <=6; j++)
 for (i = max(j-3,0); i <= j; i++)
   a[i,j] = 3
```

how do we get the reordered bounds?


## Fourier-Motzkin Method for Variable Elimination

- **Purpose**: Project a polyhedron onto a lower-dimensional space by eliminating variables from systems of linear inequalities. 


- **Variable Elimination**: Simplifies a system of linear inequalities by removing variables, reducing the dimensionality of the polyhedron while maintaining its feasibility.
- Effective for systems in **higher dimensions**.


##  Steps of Fourier-Motzkin Elimination

1. **Identify a Variable to Eliminate**:
   - Choose a variable (e.g., $i$) from the system to eliminate.

2. **Rearrange Each Inequality**:
   - Solve each inequality for the chosen variable.

3. **Eliminate the Variable**:
   - Combine pairs of inequalities to remove the chosen variable. 
   - Produce new inequalities in terms of the remaining variables.

4. **Repeat the Process**:
   - Continue eliminating variables until only the desired ones remain.

## back to this case 

``` 
for (i = 0, i < 9; i++)
  for (j = i; j < 7 && j < i+4; j++)
     a[i,j] =  3
```
in  the new version j will be the outer loop, so cannot use i in the bounds 


## Original Inequalities
1. $i \ge 0$
2. $i \le 8$ (since $i < 9$)
3. $i \le j$ (since loop starts at $j = i$)
4. $j \le 6$
5. $j \le i + 3$

## Strategy: Eliminate `i` and Determine Bounds for `j`

- To determine bounds for $j$, eliminate $i$:
  - Find all constraints involving $i$: $L \le c_1 \cdot i$ and $c_2 \cdot i \le U$
  - For each pair, derive: $c_2 \cdot L \le c_1 \cdot U$ along with constraints on $j$ only

### Derived Constraints

- Pair (1, 2): $0 \le 8$ — **Ignore**
- Pair (1, 3): $0 \le j$
- Pair (2, 5): $j - 3 \le j$ — **Ignore**
- Pair (3, 5): $j - 3 \le 8$  ⇒ $j \le 11$ — **Ignore**
- From inequality (4): $j \le 6$

**Bounds for $j$: $0 \le j \le 6$**


### Solving for `i`
- For the inner loop:
  - $i \ge 0$ and $i \ge j - 3$  ⇒  $i \ge \max(0, j-3)$
  - $i \le 8$ and $i \le j$  ⇒  \(\min(8, j) = j\), since $j \le 6$

  
## Complexity of Fourier-Motzkin

Fourier-Motzkin elimination is **computationally expensive**, especially when the number of variables is large. 

**Worst-case complexity**: The number of inequalities generated can grow exponentially with the number of variables, resulting in inefficient performance for high-dimensional systems.
- Despite this, it is still a useful tool for small to medium-dimensional systems where the elimination process can be computationally feasible.


## How much of a limitation is affine only 

99% of hpc loops are affine:

over 95% of loops in deep learning are affine:

## what about the ilp solver 

ilp is np-complete so it is slow, but often tractable for problems with up to several hundred variables.

Some compiler writers feel that means poly methods can only do this for toy programs?
  - Is the complexity a barrier for real-world compiler applications?

## Affine Functions

  - Only allow operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication by a constant.
  - Cannot multiply by unknowns or use quantifiers (e.g., ∀, ∃).
  - Can reformulate some problems but requires breaking them into simpler parts.


## Multiple Dimensions and Data Dependencies

```cpp
// Consider the following nested loops with data dependency in matrix A:
for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (j = i; j <= n; j++) {
        // S: Data dependency on A[i-1][j] and A[i][j-1]
        A[i][j] = (A[i-1][j] + A[i][j-1]) * 0.5;
    }
}
```

The computation of $A[i][j]$ depends on $A[i-1][j]$ and $A[i][j-1]$, creating a pattern of data dependencies.

## graph with tiles

```{python}
#| echo: false

n = 8 

iterations = []

# Generate iteration space
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if j < i:
            continue
        iterations.append((i,j))
print('Data Dependence for A[i][j] = (A[i-1][j] + A[i][j-1]) * 0.5')
dependence = [] 

# Annotate the iteration order and add arrows for data dependencies
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if j < i:
            continue 
        if i > 1:
            dependence.append(((i-1,j), (i,j)))
    
        if j > 1:
            dependence.append(((i,j-1), (i,j)))

print(dependence)

draw_2d_iteration_space_with_dependence_graph(iterations, dependence, tile =2 )

```

The schedule traverses the matrix in an upward direction for each column (`j`), moving left to right across columns (`i`).

adding tiles does not have a problem when dependence, but with-in each tile have to execute serially

## Formalizing the Schedule: Lexicographic Ordering

- **Schedule Mapping:** $s(i,j) \rightarrow (i,j)$
- **Statements as Vectors:** Considered as 'times' (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds)

## Understanding Lexicographic Ordering

$$(i,j) \gg (m,n) \iff i > m \lor (i = m \land j > n)$$

- Compare elements from left to right.
- Continue comparison on equal terms.
- Lexicographic order generalizes alphabetical order (→).


## Checking for loop interchange 

```
for i in [1,2,3,4]                     for j in [1,2,3]
  for j in [1,2,3]                       for i in [1,2,3,4]
s:   a(i,j) = a(i-1,j+1)                   a(i,j) = a(i-1,j+1)  

```

- **Original Schedule:** $s(i, j) \rightarrow (i,j)$
- **After Interchange:** $s(i,j) \rightarrow (j,i)$

data flow 

```
        read write
s(1,1)  a(0,2)  a(1,1)
s(1,2)  a(0,3)  a(1,2)
s(1,3)  a(0,4)  a(1,3)
s(1,4)  a(0,5)  a(1,4)
s(2,1)  a(1,2)  a(2,1)   s(1,2)-> s(2,1)
s(2,2)  a(1,3)  a(2,2)   s(1,3)-> s(2.2)
```


$$
s(i,j) \rightarrow s(i+1, j-1)
$$

## constants:

Does there exist a statement s(i,j) and a statement $s(i',j')$
where in the new schedule $s(i',j')$ executes first and  data flows backward in time 
$$
\begin{align*}
(i', j') \gg (j,i)   &\text{ $i',j'$ is first} \\
i' = 1+ i            &\text{ data\  from \ i+1 to $i'$}\\
j' = -1 +j           &\text{ data\  from \ j-1 to $j'$}\\
1 \le i \le 4 \\
1 \le j \le 3  \\
1 \le i' \le 4 \\
1 \le j' \leftrightarrows 3
\end{align*}
$$

because of the lexicographic order  we have two ilp problems
one where $i'$ is greater then j, and one where $i'$ = j

## solution

I ran it through:

https://online-optimizer.appspot.com

which gave me a solution:

s(4,2) reads  s(3,3) but s(4,2) executes first 

## finding transformations:

```
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    P:  a(i) = input(i) + 1
for j in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    c:  b(j) = a(j) + 2
```

what transformation will give the best locality?

## poly form 

Each loop can be represented by its iteration space in a polyhedral form.

Loop 1: $𝑖 \in [0,1,2,3,5]$

Loop 2: $j \in [0,1,2,3,4,5]$

The dependencies between the two loops are: $p(i)$ must be computed before $c(i)$

## define a new schedule 

We introduce a schedule for each loop using affine transformations. (we can only handle affine transformations )

For the first loop:
$$\theta_1(i) = \alpha_1 i + \beta_1$$

For the second loop:
$$\theta_2(j) = \alpha_2 j + \beta_2$$

The goal is to reorder the iterations such that all dependencies are respected and memory locality is improved.

## solving

We have to find four scalars 

For all $i, j$ such that $p(i)$ sends data to $c(j)$, the following constraint holds:

$$\text{if } p(i) \to c(j), \quad \text{then } \theta_1(i) \leq  \theta_2(j).$$

For all $0 \leq i \leq 5$ and $0 \leq j \leq 5$, and $i=j$  the following condition holds:
$$\theta_1(i) \leq theta_2(j)$$

expanding this out 

$$\alpha_1 i + \beta_1 \leq \alpha_2 j + \beta_2$$

looks bad- non-linear constraint since there is a product,  and the foralls do not work with solvers 

## magic 

We apply a theorem called the affine form of the Farkas lemma which turns this into a tractable problem 

An affine form is non-negative over a polyhedron if and only if it can be be written as a non-negative combination of the constraints that form the polyhedron 

## parallelism 

we minimized the time between definition and use, for best locality, if we maximize that time we get the most parallel code
