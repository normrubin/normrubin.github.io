1. Measurement bias is significant
1. Changing aspects of an experimental setup can introduce measurement bias. ​
Measurement bias is unpredictable and there are no obvious ways to avoid it. ​
Prior work in computer system evaluation does not adequately consider measurement bias. ​
1. The paper discusses two techniques for dealing with measurement bias: experimental setup randomization and causal analysis. ​
1. Measurement bias occurs for all benchmarks and architectures. ​
1. Measurement bias due to link order can significantly fluctuate conclusions. ​
1. Measurement bias due to UNIX environment size can lead to conflicting conclusions. ​
1. To avoid measurement bias, it is important to use diverse evaluation workloads, randomize the experimental setup, conduct causal analysis, and collect more information from hardware manufacturers. ​

## violin plots 

[data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/cpu-and-gpu-product-data)

A dataset with 2,185 CPUs and 2,668 GPUs to help researchers understand the development trend of CPUs and GPUs. Setup by Kaggle



```{python}

# library & dataset
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


df = pd.read_csv('images/chip_dataset.csv')
print(df.head())

sns.set_palette("pastel")

sns.violinplot(x=df["Vendor"], y=np.log(df["Freq (MHz)"]), hue=df['Type'])


```

apply np.log to the Freq (MHz) column.  Because of wide range of values

Set a pastel palette with sns.set_palette("pastel"). These colors make it easier to see the parts of the violin plot

Hue Parameter: I'm using the hue parameter to differentiate between types of chips. Hue sets a color within the palette

Data Source and Preparation: Include a brief note on where the data comes from (you've provided a link, but a sentence or two summarizing the dataset would be helpful) and any preprocessing steps taken before visualization.


I might want to take date into account in these plots

A violin plot shows density curves.  The width is the approximate frequency of data points at that value 

Best for comparing distributions 

consider ordering the groups 

The details 

1. the white dot represents the median
1. the thick gray bar in the center represents the inter-quartile range
1. the thin gray line represents the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be “outliers” using a method that is a function of the inter-quartile range.
1. On each side of the gray line is a kernel density estimation to show the distribution shape of the data. Wider sections of the violin plot represent a higher probability that members of the population will take on the given value; the skinnier sections represent a lower probability.


## error bars 

```{python}

print(df.describe())

import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'Release Date' is the column
df['Release Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Release Date'], errors='coerce')
df['Release Year'] = ((df['Release Date'].dt.year) // 5) * 5

# Now df['Release Year'] contains the year extracted from 'Release Date'


# plot a bar chart
ax = sns.barplot(x=df['Release Year'], y=df["TDP (W)"], hue =df['Type'], estimator=np.mean, errorbar=("sd"))

```
